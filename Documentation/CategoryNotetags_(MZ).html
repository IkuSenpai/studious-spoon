  interpreted as JavaScript code. If the JavaScript code fails, it will
  default to a 0 value.

  *NOTE* JavaScript cannot be used without comparison operators to reduce
  error. This means if you want to check if a switch is on or not, don't
  simply use "$gameSwitches.value(42)" as it does not have any comparison
  operators. Instead, use "$gameSwitches.value(42) === true" to check.

  *NOTE* To make any of these conditions base off of the user instead, add
  the word 'user' before the condition as such:

  user hp% &gt;= 0.50
  user atk buff stacks === 2
  user team alive members &lt; 3

  [ and ] brackets around the text that will be used as the Common Event's
  key text.
  - For example, if Common Event's name is "Penta Slash [PENTA]", then the
    key used is "PENTA" without the quotes.
  - This key could then be referenced by &lt;Common Event Key: PENTA&gt; notetag.

<pre>&lt;Sideview Idle Motion: name&gt;

&lt;Sideview Idle Motions&gt;
 name: weight
 name: weight
 name: weight
&lt;/Sideview Idle Motions&gt;

- Used for: Enemy Notetags
- Changes the default idle motion for the enemy.
- Replace 'name' with any of the following motion names:
  - 'walk', 'wait', 'chant', 'guard', 'damage', 'evade', 'thrust', 'swing',
    'missile', 'skill', 'spell', 'item', 'escape', 'victory', 'dying',
    'abnormal', 'sleep', 'dead'
- If the multiple notetag vaiant is used, then a random motion name is
  selected from the list upon the enemy's creation.
- Replace 'weight' with a number value representing how often the 'name'
  would come up. The higher the weight, the more often. You may omit this
  and the colon(:) and just type in the 'name' instead.
- Add/remove lines as you see fit.

Example:

&lt;Sideview Idle Motions&gt;
 walk: 25
 wait: 50
 guard
 victory
 abnormal
&lt;/Sideview Idle Motions&gt;
</pre>
<p>---
</p>
<pre>&lt;Sideview Size: width, height&gt;

- Used for: Enemy Notetags

- Used for: Enemy Notetags
- Give your sideview enemies weapons to use.
- Replace 'weapontype' with the name of the weapon type found under the
  Database =&gt; Types =&gt; Weapon Types list (without text codes).
- If the multiple notetag vaiant is used, then a random weapon type is
  selected from the list upon the enemy's creation.
- Replace 'weight' with a number value representing how often the weapontype
  would come up. The higher the weight, the more often. You may omit this
  and the colon(:) and just type in the 'weapontype' instead.

- Used for: Enemy Notetags
- Requires VisuMZ_1_ElementStatusCore
- Allows certain Trait Sets to cause battlers to have a unique appearance.
- Replace 'filename' with the filename of the graphic to use. Do not insert
  any extensions. This means the file 'Actor1_1.png' will be only inserted
  as 'Actor1_1' without the '.png' at the end.
- If the multiple notetag vaiant is used, then a random filename is selected
  from the list upon the enemy's creation.

&lt;/Swap Enemies&gt;

- Used for: Enemy Notetags
- Causes this enemy database object to function as a randomizer for any of
  the listed enemies inside the notetag. When the enemy is loaded into the
  battle scene, the enemy is immediately replaced with one of the enemies
  listed. The randomization is based off the 'weight' given to each of the
  enemy 'names'.
- Replace 'name' with the database enemy of the enemy you wish to replace
  the enemy with.
- Replace 'weight' with a number value representing how often the 'name'
  would come up. The higher the weight, the more often. You may omit this

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="JavaScript_Notetags:_Mechanics-Related">JavaScript Notetags: Mechanics-Related</span></h3>
<p>These JavaScript notetags allow you to run code at specific instances during
battle provided that the unit has that code associated with them in a trait
object (actor, class, weapon, armor, enemy, or state). How you use these is
entirely up to you and will depend on your ability to understand the code

<pre>&lt;Once Parallel When Start Battle&gt;

- Used for: Troop Page Comment Tags
- Causes the troop page to immediately load the moment the battle scene
  begins to fade in (not after it fades in). This is faster than a turn 0
  condition troop page. Troop page conditions are ignored.
- This can be used for things like the Action Sequence Camera plugin, the
  Visual Battle Environment plugin, and/or initial battle poses and such in
  order to provide a near seamless battle transition experience.
- This does NOT trigger when coming out of the options menu or party menu.
- This WILL trigger when going from battle to battle nonstop via plugins
  like VisuStella MZ's Chain Battles.
- When actors are moving towards their home positions, it will take around
  30 frames by default. Use this information however you like.

<pre>&lt;Start Rank: x&gt;
&lt;Start Ranks: x, x, x&gt;

&lt;Start Flank: x&gt;
&lt;Start Flanks: x, x, x&gt;

- Used for: Actor and Enemy Notetags
- If "Battle Grid Tactics" is enabled, ignore this for actors. The grid
  tactics menu will determine where actors will start in battle.
- Determines the preferred starting Rank/Flank 'x' node for this battler.
- If another allied battler is already on that node, then this battler will
  pick the next available 'x' Rank/Flank.
- If none of the preferred Ranks/Flanks are available, then the battler will
  start at the next suitable location without getting in another battler's
  way.
- Replace 'x' with a number representing the ideal starting Ranks/Flanks for
  this battler with higher priority given to the numbers at the start.
- This notetag can be used together with each otherfor more precise starting
  node locations.
</pre>
<p>---
</p>
<pre>&lt;Grid Size: r X f&gt;

- Used for: Enemy Notetags
- Changes the space occupied by this enemy to be 'r' Ranks and 'f' Flanks.
- This turns the enemy into a "Large Enemy" and "Large Enemies" have the
  special properties listed below:
  - Large enemies will occupy multiple nodes at the same time and will take
    on any of the effects applied all of the occupied nodes.
  - Large enemies cannot move or be moved to different nodes.
  - Large enemies will bypass the usage requirements for the notetag:
    &lt;rule Move User Node direction: x&gt;
  - If a small enemy transforms into a large enemy, the enemy will adjust
    its node position in order to accomodate fitting in the grid. It may or
    may not overlap other enemies and will do little to change that in order
    to avoid conflicts. Be wary of transforming enemies from smaller sizes
    to larger sizes as this can look very janky.
- If there is not enough space on the grid to fit all enemies listed in the
  troop, the plugin will ask you to redesign that troop.

  Examples:

  &lt;Grid Size: 1 X 3&gt;
  &lt;Grid Size: 2 X 2&gt;
  &lt;Grid Size: 3 X 2&gt;
  &lt;Grid Size: 4 X 3&gt;

<pre>&lt;rule Move User Node direction: x&gt;

- Used for: Skill, Item Notetags
- Upon using this skill/item, the user will move 'x' nodes in the specified
  'direction' while following the movement 'rule' needed.
  - This effect will occur before applying damage or other effects.
  - This effect will occur regardless of missing or evasion.
  - This effect will occur only once during the action and will not trigger
    multiple times with a multi-hit or multi-target skill/item.
  - This effect will NOT occur when used by Triggers.
- Replace 'rule' with any of the following text to for movement ruling:
  - Must, Mid, Must Mid, Switch, Switch Mid, Must Switch, Must Switch Mid

    - Must - User MUST be able to land on target node or else the user
      cannot move and the skill/item will be rendered unusable. If there are
      any obstacles or allies on that node, the user cannot move and cannot
      use the skill/item.

    - Mid - User aims to land on target node, but will stop mid-way if any
      allies or obstacles are in the way. User will stop at earliest node.
      If the user cannot move past the initial node, the skill/item will be
      used as if there's no need to move.

    - Must Mid - Same as the above except if the user cannot move past the
      initial node, the skill/item cannot be used.

    - Switch - Moves to target node. If there is an ally on target node that
      can switch, the user will switch positions with that ally and then the
      skill/item can be used. If the user cannot move to target node, then
      the skill/item will be used as if there's no need to move.

    - Switch Mid - User will try to move to target node. If there is an ally
      on the way towards the target node that can switch, then the user will
      switch with the ally even if the ally is not at the target node. The
      user will stop halfway for any other obstacles. If the user cannot
      move past the initial node, the skill/item will be used as if there's
      no need to move.

    - Must Switch - User must move to target node where there is an ally
      that can switch positions. If not, the skill/item cannot be used.

    - Must Switch Mid - User will try to move towards target node. If there
      are any allies on the way that can switch, then the user will switch
      with that ally even if the ally is not at the target node and then the
      skill/item can be used. Otherwise, the skill/item cannot be used even
      if there is a clear path to the target node.

- Replace 'direction' with any of the following text for direction:
  - Forward, Backward, Upward, Downward, Leftward, Rightward
  - Up-Forward, Up-Backward, Up-Leftward, Up-Rightward
  - Down-Forward, Down-Backward, Down-Leftward, Down-Rightward
- Replace 'x' with a number representing the number of nodes to move in the
  specified direction.

  Examples:

  &lt;Must Move User Node Upward: 1&gt;
  &lt;Switch Move User Node Downward: 1&gt;
  &lt;Mid Move User Node Forward: 2&gt;
  &lt;Mid Move User Node Backward: 2&gt;

    multiple times with a multi-hit or multi-target skill/item.
  - This effect will not affect the user if the user performed a self
    movement effect with the &lt;rule Move User Node direction: x&gt; notetag.
  - This effect will NOT occur when used by Triggers.
- Replace 'rule' with any of the following text to for movement ruling:
  - Exact, Mid, Switch, Switch Mid, Crash, Crash Mid

    - Exact - Aims to move target to target node and will take no other
      nodes except for that exact target node. If target cannot be moved to
      target node due to it being out of bounds or there being any battlers
      on that node, then no movements will be made.

    - Mid - Aims to move target to target node, but will stop mid-way if any
      battlers or obstacles are in the way. Target will stop at earliest
      node. However, if the target cannot move past the initial node, then
      no movements will be made.

    - Switch - Target a specific node and moves the target there. If there
      is a battler on target node, the target will switch positions with
      that battler if the battler can switch. If the other battler cannot
      switch, then the target will not move.

    - Switch Mid - Same as the above except the target will stop at the
      earliest available node. If there is a battler on the way, the target
      will switch places with that battler if the battler can switch nodes.
      If there are no available nodes, then the battler will not move.

    - Crash - Aims to move target to target node, but if there is another
      battler on that node, then crashing will occur and both the target and
      the battler will take crash damage. The battler will remain in place
      while the target moves back to its original node.

    - Crash Mid - Aims to move target to target node, but will stop at the
      earliest node. If there's a battler in the way, then crashing will
      occur and both the target and battler will take crash damage. The
      battler will remain in place while the target stops at the last
      availabe node before the crash.

- Replace 'direction' with any of the following text for direction:
  - Forward, Backward, Upward, Downward, Leftward, Rightward
  - Up-Forward, Up-Backward, Up-Leftward, Up-Rightward
  - Down-Forward, Down-Backward, Down-Leftward, Down-Rightward
- Replace 'x' with a number representing the number of nodes to move in the
  specified direction.

  Examples:

  &lt;Mid Move Target Node Forward: 1&gt;
  &lt;Switch Move Target Node Forward: 1&gt;
  &lt;Switch Mid Move Target Node Backward: 2&gt;
  &lt;Crash Move Target Node Forward: 1&gt;

<pre>&lt;Max Stackable Charges: x&gt;

- State Notetags
- Requires VisuMZ_1_SkillsStatesCore!
- Allows the max stackable charges for the state to become 'x'.
- Replace 'x' with a number representing the maximum charges the state can
  potentially have. If 'x' is lower than the default charge amount, 'x' will
  become the default charge amount.
- This is not a Consumable Defensive State notetag and can therefore be used
  together with the above notetags.
- If this notetag is not present, whenever a Consumable Defensive State is
  reapplied, the charge number resets. With this notetag, the charges become

<p>The following are notetags that have been added through this plugin. These
notetags will not work with your game if this plugin is OFF or not present.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Actors-Related_Notetags">Actors-Related Notetags</span></h3>
<p>Parameter limits can be adjusted in the Plugin Parameters, but this won't
lift the ability to change the values of an actor's initial or max level
past the editor's limits. Instead, this must be done through the usage of
notetags to accomplish the feat.
</p><p>---
</p>
<pre>&lt;Max Level: x&gt;

- Used for: Actor Notetags
- Replace 'x' with an integer to determine the actor's max level.
- This allows you to go over the database limit of 99.
- If this notetag isn't used, default to the actor's database value.
</pre>
<p>---
</p>
<pre>&lt;Initial Level: x&gt;

- Used for: Actor Notetags
- Replace 'x' with an integer to determine the actor's initial level.
- This allows you to go over the database limit of 99.
- If this notetag isn't used, default to the actor's database value.
</pre>
<p>---
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Classes-Related_Notetags">Classes-Related Notetags</span></h3>
<p>As actor levels can now surpass 99 due to the notetag system, there may be
some skills you wish certain classes can learn upon reaching higher levels
past 99, too.
</p><p>---
</p>
<pre>&lt;Learn At Level: x&gt;

- Used for: Class Skill Learn Notetags
- Replace 'x' with an integer to determine the level this class will learn
  the associated skill at.
- This allows you to go over the database limit of 99.
- If this notetag isn't used, default to the class's database value.
</pre>
<p>---
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Enemies-Related_Notetags">Enemies-Related Notetags</span></h3>
<p>Enemies are now given levels. The levels don't do anything except to serve
as a container for a number value. This way, levels can be used in damage
formulas (ie. a.atk - b.level) without causing any errors. To give enemies
levels, use the notetags below. These notetags also allow you to adjust the
base parameters, EXP, and Gold past the database limitations.
</p><p>---
</p>
<pre>&lt;Level: x&gt;

- Used for: Enemy Notetags
- Replace 'x' with an integer to determine the enemy's level.
- If no level is declared, the level will default to 1.
</pre>
<p>---
</p>
<pre>&lt;param: x&gt;

- Used for: Enemy Notetags
- Replace 'param' with 'MaxHP', 'MaxMP', 'ATK', 'DEF', 'MAT', 'MDF', 'AGI',
  or 'LUK' to determine which parameter to alter.
  - This notetag does NOT work with X Parameters, S Parameters, or any
    custom parameters. This notetag ONLY works with the base parameters.
- Replace 'x' with an integer to set an enemy's 'param' base value.
- This will overwrite the enemy's database value and can exceed the original
  value limitation in the database.
- If these notetags aren't used, default to the enemy's database value.
</pre>
<p>---
</p>
<pre>&lt;EXP: x&gt;
&lt;Gold: x&gt;

- Used for: Enemy Notetags
- Replace 'x' with an integer to determine the enemy's EXP or Gold values.

</p><p>Animations in RPG Maker MZ are done by Effekseer and the animation system
has been revamped. However, the animations are only centered on the targets
now, and cannot be attached to the head or foot. Insert these tags into
the names of the animations in the database to adjust their positions.
</p><p>---
</p>
<pre>&lt;Head&gt;
&lt;Foot&gt;

- Used for: Animation Name Tags
- Will set the animation to anchor on top of the sprite (if &lt;Head&gt; is used)
  or at the bottom of the sprite (if &lt;Foot&gt; is used).
</pre>
<p>---
</p>
<pre>&lt;Anchor X: x&gt;
&lt;Anchor Y: y&gt;

&lt;Anchor: x, y&gt;

- Used for: Animation Name Tags
- Will anchor the animation at a specific point within the sprite based on
  the 'x' and 'y' values.
- Replace 'x' and 'y' with numeric values representing their positions based
  on a rate where 0.0 is the furthest left/up (x, y respectively) to 1.0 for
  the furthest right/down (x, y respectively).

Examples:

&lt;Anchor X: 0.4&gt;
&lt;Anchor Y: 0.8&gt;

&lt;Anchor: 0.2, 0.9&gt;
</pre>

&lt;Offset Y: +y&gt;
&lt;Offset Y: -y&gt;

&lt;Offset: +x, +y&gt;
&lt;Offset: -x, -y&gt;

- Used for: Animation Name Tags
- Will anchor the animation to be offset by an exact number of pixels.
- This does the same the editor does, except it lets you input values
  greater than 999 and lower than -999.
- Replace 'x' and 'y' with numeric values the exact number of pixels to
  offset the animation's x and y coordinates by.

Examples:

&lt;Offset X: +20&gt;
&lt;Offset Y: -50&gt;

&lt;Offset: +10, -30&gt;
</pre>
<p>---
</p>
<pre>&lt;Mirror Offset X&gt;
&lt;No Mirror Offset X&gt;

- Used for: Animation Name Tags
- If an animation is mirrored, you can choose to have the animation's Offset
  X value be mirrored, too (or not at all).
- If no name tag is discovered, this will use the setting found in the
  Plugin Parameters &gt; QoL Settings &gt; Misc &gt; Ani: Mirror Offset X setting.
</pre>
<p>---
</p>
<pre>&lt;Rate: x&gt;

- Used for: MV Animation Name Tags
- Allows you to adjust the update for this MV Animation.
  - Does NOT work with Effekseer animations.
- The lower the number, the faster.
- Replace 'x' with a number representing the animation update rate.
  - Default rate: 4.
  - Minimum rate: 1.
  - Maximum rate: 10.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Quality_of_Life-Related_Notetags">Quality of Life-Related Notetags</span></h3>
<p>By default, RPG Maker MZ does not offer an encounter step minimum after a
random encounter has finished. This means that one step immediately after
finishing a battle, the player can immediately enter another battle. The
Quality of Life improvement: Minimum Encounter Steps allows you to set a
buffer range between battles for the player to have some breathing room.
</p><p>---
</p>
<pre>&lt;Minimum Encounter Steps: x&gt;

- Used for: Map Notetags
- Replace 'x' with the minimum number of steps before the player enters a
  random encounter on that map.
- If this notetag is not used, then the minimum encounter steps for the map
  will default to Quality of Life Settings =&gt; Encounter Rate Min.
</pre>
<p>---
</p><p>Tile shadows are automatically added to certain tiles in the map editor.
These tile shadows may or may not fit some types of maps. You can turn them
on/off with the Quality of Life Plugin Parameters or you can override the
settings with the following notetags:
</p>
<pre>&lt;Show Tile Shadows&gt;
&lt;Hide Tile Shadows&gt;

- Used for: Map Notetags
- Use the respective notetag for the function you wish to achieve.
- If this notetag is not used, then the tileset shadow settings for the map
  will default to Quality of Life Settings =&gt; No Tile Shadows.
</pre>
<p>---
</p>
<pre>&lt;Scroll Lock X&gt;
&lt;Scroll Lock Y&gt;

- Used for: Map Notetags
- Will prevent the map from being able to scroll left/right(x) or up/down(y)
  if these notetags are present.
- Useful for when maps are just slightly smaller than normal and the tiny
  scrolling is distracting.
- This will use the display nudge setting found in the Plugin Parameters.
- This setting will be disabled if the map is zoomed in.
</pre>
<p>---
</p>
<pre>&lt;Scroll Lock X: x&gt;
&lt;Scroll Lock Y: y&gt;

- Used for: Map Notetags
- Will prevent the map from being able to scroll left/right(x) or up/down(y)
  if these notetags are present and will nudge the map camera slightly.
- Useful for when maps are just slightly smaller than normal and the tiny
  scrolling is distracting.
- Replace 'x' and 'y' with numbers between 0 and 1 to represent how much is
  being judged.
  - For example, for a 1280x720 resolution, a 27 tile wide map will benefit
    from a nudge of 0.15625. Play with these numbers to determine the best
    value for your maps.
- This setting will be disabled if the map is zoomed in.

  the player has entered the map at a specific 'season'.
  - If the player has entered the map at a specific 'season', but time has
    moved forward and the season has changed, the season will be whatever it
    was upon the time the player has entered in order to prevent any weird
    and out of place transitions from happening.
- Replace 'season' with a string representing the season.
  - Seasons are: "spring", "summer", "autumn", "winter" (no quotes).
- Replace 'filename' with the filename of the graphic to use. Do not insert
  any extensions. This means the file 'Castle1.png' will be only inserted

</p>
<pre>&lt;type Swap To: x&gt;

- Used for: Tileset Notetags
- If a map loads a tileset with this notetag and it happens to be that
  season, swap to 'x' tileset instead and repeat the check.
  - The repeated check will only last for 5 checks max for each map loading.
- Replace 'type' with a string representing the season or cycle.
  - Seasons are: "spring", "summer", "autumn", "winter" (no quotes).
  - Cycles are: "dawn", "day", "dusk", "night" (no quotes).
  - Priority will be given to seasons first before cycles.
  - Insert multiples of this notetag to cover different cases.
- Each successful check will result in another check on the newer tileset
  for up to 5 times.
- This can be chained in such a way where an "Outdoor" tileset can chain
  into something like "Summer Outdoor", which can then be chained into
  "Summer Outdoor Day" or "Summer Outdoor Night" for more accuracy.
- Priority will be given to seasons first, then  the day cycles (dawn, day,
  dusk, night). This way, you can ensure that the tileset you're using
  matches the conditions of the season or time of day if so desired.
- If time changes into a new season or day cycle while on the map, there
  won't be any changes made immediately. Instead, the player must exit and
  reenter the map for the changes to be seen. This is to prevent any awkward
  changes and transitions that may occur otherwise.
</pre>
<p>---
</p>
<pre>&lt;Bypass Tileset Swap&gt;

- Used for: Map Notetags
- If a map with this notetag loads a tileset that would normally swap out,
  this will prevent it from happening.
- This can be used for things like flashbacks where it would make sense for
  a specific tileset to be used as opposed to the current season's variant.

&lt;Turns If Night Hours: -y&gt;

- Used for: State Notetags
- Requires VisuMZ_1_SkillsStatesCore!
- These state durations will have their turn counts affected by '+y' or '-y'
  when it is the specific season, weekday type, or day cycle.
- Replace 'y' with a number representing the turn count change.
- If multiples of these notetags are used together, the effects will be
  additive.
  - For example, if state's turn count drops by -1 at the dusk hours of the
    day, and state's turn count also drops by -1 on weekends, then the dusk
    hours of a weekend day will have the state's turn count drop by -2.

<pre>&lt;Dragonbones Battler: filename&gt;

- Used for: Actor, Enemy Notetags
- Sets the DragonBones associated with this actor/enemy to be 'filename'.
- The name will be associated with the assets used.
- It will be used to check for associated filenames that end with _ske.json,
  _tex.json, and _tex.png.
- The listed assets must be found in the assigned assets folder.

Examples:

&lt;Dragonbones Battler: Demon&gt;
&lt;Dragonbones Battler: DragonBoy&gt;
&lt;Dragonbones Battler: Swordsman&gt;
&lt;Dragonbones Battler: Ubbie&gt;

<pre>&lt;Dragonbones Battler Scale: x, y&gt;

&lt;Dragonbones Battler Scale X: x&gt;
&lt;Dragonbones Battler Scale Y: x&gt;

- Used for: Actor, Enemy Notetags
- Sets the base scale for the Dragonbones associated with this actor/enemy.
  This is for those instances where a Dragonbones armature is too large or
  small and needs to be scaled down/up.
- This scale will be amplified by the actor/enemy's sprite's scale value.
- Use the 1st notetag to assign values to both Scale X and Scale Y.
- Use the 2nd/3rd notetags to assign Scale X and Y values separately.
- Use negative values to flip the Dragonbones armature around.

Examples:

&lt;Dragonbones Battler Scale: -0.3, 0.3&gt;

&lt;Dragonbones Battler Scale X: -0.3&gt;
&lt;Dragonbones Battler Scale Y: 0.3&gt;

<pre>&lt;Dragonbones Battler Offset: x, y&gt;

&lt;Dragonbones Battler Offset X: x&gt;
&lt;Dragonbones Battler Offset Y: x&gt;

- Used for: Actor, Enemy Notetags
- When a Dragonbones armature is attached to an actor/enemy's sprite, it
  will always be attached at the root point assigned within the Dragonbones
  data. If a Dragonbones armature has a root point that does not fit well
  with your battler sprite, you can offset it using these notetags.
- Replace 'x' and 'y' with number values representing how many pixels you
  want to offset the Dragonbones armature by.
- Use the 1st notetag to assign values to both Offset X and Offset Y.
- Use the 2nd/3rd notetags to assign Offset X and Y values separately.
- Use negative values to offset to the left (X) or up (Y) directions.

Examples:

&lt;Dragonbones Battler Offset: -10, 5&gt;

&lt;Dragonbones Battler Offset X: -10&gt;
&lt;Dragonbones Battler Offset Y: 5&gt;

<pre>&lt;Dragonbones Battler Size: width, height&gt;

&lt;Dragonbones Battler Width: x&gt;
&lt;Dragonbones Battler Height: x&gt;

- Used for: Actor, Enemy Notetags
- Dragonbones armatures have no standard width or height. This makes it
  problematic when trying to calculate the sprite's width/height for Action
  Sequences and the like. These notetags allow you to assign a width and
  height value to the sprite, despite the fact the Dragonbones armatures
  have no such thing.
- Replace 'width', 'height', or 'x' with number values representing the
  dimension values in pixels.
- Use the 1st notetag to assign values to both Width and Height.
- Use the 2nd/3rd notetags to assign Width and Height values separately.
- If these notetags aren't used, then use the values defined by default in
  Plugin Parameters =&gt; Battler Settings =&gt; Default =&gt; Width/Height.

Examples:

&lt;Dragonbones Battler Size: 50, 100&gt;

&lt;Dragonbones Battler Width: 50&gt;
&lt;Dragonbones Battler Height: 100&gt;

<pre>&lt;Dragonbones Battler Time Scale: x&gt;

- Used for: Actor, Enemy Notetags
- Lets you adjust the time scale for the Dragonbones armature.
- Replace 'x' with a number value depicting how fast the armature should
  animate.
  - 1.0 is the default value.
  - Higher numbers animate faster.
  - Lower numbers animate slower.
  - If a number is too small, it may not animate at all.

&lt;Dragonbones Battler Motion Abnormal: animation&gt;
&lt;Dragonbones Battler Motion Sleep: animation&gt;
&lt;Dragonbones Battler Motion Dead: animation&gt;

- Used for: Actor, Enemy Notetags
- Use these notetags to assign Dragonbones animations to play when the
  actor/enemy sprite is supposed to play such a motion.
- Replace 'animation' with the name of the Dragonbones animation.
- If this notetag is not used, when such a motion is rquested, it will
  default to attempting to play the animation name equal to the motion.
- Animation names do not need to be case sensitive.
- If no animation is found, then no animation will be played.

Examples:

&lt;Dragonbones Battler Motion Wait: idle&gt;

<p>The following comment tags are to be put inside of the pages of events,
troops, and common events for them to work!
</p><p>---
</p>
<pre>&lt;Page Conditions&gt;
  conditions
  conditions
  conditions
&lt;/Page Conditions&gt;

- Used for: Map Event Page, Troop Page, and Common Event Page Comment Tags
- This allows you to create custom page conditions that utilize the
  Conditional Branch event command to see if the additional page conditions
  are met.
</pre>
<p>---
</p>
<pre>&lt;Conditions Met&gt;
- Used for: Map Event Page, Troop Page, and Common Event Page Comment Tags
- If used between the &lt;Page Conditions&gt; and &lt;/Page Conditions&gt; comment tag,
  upon reaching this part of event command list, the custom page conditions
  will be considered met.

<pre>Example:

◆Comment：&lt;Page Conditions&gt;
◆If：Reid has equipped Potion Sword
  ◆Comment：If Reid has equipped the Potion Sword
：       ：&lt;Condition Met&gt;
  ◆
：End
◆Comment：&lt;/Page Conditions&gt;

If Reid has the "Potion Sword" weapon equipped, then the additional custom
page conditions are met and the event page will be present/active.

If this is a troop condition, the troop page event will activate.

If this is a common event, there will be a parallel common event active.

  the current event's X/Y coordinates. It's just grown more vertically and
  is still centered horizontally.
- This is primarily used to save on having to use too many events for tiles
  that expanded past 1x1 tile sizes.

  decorations).
- Replace 'x' with a number between 1 and 7 representing the Terrain Tag
  associated with this notetag effect.
  - Insert multiple numbers to expand the tiles that the furniture can
    be placed on.
- This notetag CANNOT be used together on the same object with the notetag:
  &lt;Furniture Allow Terrain Tag: x&gt; and variants.
- If this notetag is not used, then the Allowed Terrain Tag settings will
  default to whatever setting is found in this plugin's Plugin Parameters.
</pre>
<p>---
</p>
<pre>&lt;Furniture Forbid Terrain Tag: x&gt;
&lt;Furniture Forbid Terrain Tags: x, x, x&gt;

- Used for: Item Notetags
- Dictates the terrain tag tiles that the player CANNOT place this piece of
  furniture on. In other words, you cannot place furniture on tiles with
  this terrain tag.
- Replace 'x' with a number between 1 and 7 representing the Terrain Tag
  associated with this notetag effect.
  - Insert multiple numbers to expand the tiles that the furniture cannot
    be placed on.
- This notetag CANNOT be used together on the same object with the notetag:
  &lt;Furniture Forbid Terrain Tag: x&gt; and variants.
- If this notetag is not used, then the Forbid Terrain Tag settings will
  default to whatever setting is found in this plugin's Plugin Parameters.
</pre>
<p>---
</p>
<pre>&lt;Furniture Check Event Collision&gt;
&lt;Furniture Allow Event Stacking&gt;

- Used for: Item Notetags
- Causes the furniture object to check for event collision or let the player
  stack events on a single tile infinitely.
- We recommend not using the "Allow" version. Best leave this notetag alone
  unless you absolutely know what you're doing with it.
- If either of these notetags are not used, then the default settings will
  be determined by the setting found in this plugin's Plugin Parameters.
</pre>
<p>---
</p>
<pre>&lt;Furniture Need Passability&gt;
&lt;Furniture Free Passability&gt;

- Used for: Item Notetags
- The "Need" notetag variant determines if the furniture object checks if
  the tile it's placed on must have passability in order to be valid.
- The "Free" notetag variant version does the opposite; it does not need any
  passability settings.
- This effect is ignored with the Allowed Region/Terrain Tag notetags.
- If either of these notetags are not used, then the default settings will
  be determined by the setting found in this plugin's Plugin Parameters.
- *NOTE!* The passability check does not work well with the A4 Tiles.
  Unfortunately, there is not much we can do about this because of the way
  RPG Maker MZ handles it. No matter how you mark them in the database, RPG
  Maker MZ will decide that they are passable. You have to work around this
  with Forbid Region notetags or Forbid Terrain Tag notetags.
</pre>
<p>---
</p>
<pre>&lt;Furniture Place Common Event: x&gt;

- Used for: Item Notetags
- Runs a Common Event when the furniture object is placed.
- Replace 'x' with a number representing the ID of the Common Event to run.
- If this notetag is not used, then the default settings for this effect
  will be determined by this plugin's Plugin Parameters.
</pre>
<p>---
</p>

&lt;Furniture Place Until Empty&gt;

  only exit after the items placing them have been emptied out (or until the
  player presses cancel).

  will be determined by this plugin's Plugin Parameters.
</pre>
<p>---
</p>
<pre>&lt;Furniture Prevent Cancel Exit&gt;

- Used for: Item Notetags
- For those weird times where you don't want the player to be able to cancel

- Used for: Weapon
- This weapon cannot be equipped with other weapons of the same type once

<pre>&lt;Party Artifact&gt;
&lt;Troop Artifact&gt;

&lt;Stackable Party Artifact&gt;
&lt;Stackable Troop Artifact&gt;

 requirement
 requirement
 requirement
&lt;/Equip Requirements&gt;

- Used for: Weapon, Armor Notetags
- Defines a requirement(s) for the actor to meet in order for the equip item
  to be equippable.
- Failure to meet these requirements will cause the equipment to unequip
  automatically.
  - Keep in mind that in some cases, this will not happen immediately.
    Things like switches will require the actor to meet its cache clear
    in order to trigger the automatic unequip.
  - Some ways to trigger a cache clear would be to change the actor's HP/MP,
    or adding and then removing a state for the actor (preferrably an unused
    state that has no real effect).
- Replace 'requirement' with one of the settings bellow:
- Add multiple 'requirement' lines for more requirements.

  Requirements:

  param &gt; x
  param &gt;= x
  param === x
  param &lt;= x
  param &lt; x
  - Replace 'param' with 'level', 'maxhp', 'maxmp', 'atk', 'def', 'mat',
    'mdf', 'agi', or 'luk'.
  - This will make the piece of equipment require the actor's base parameter
    to be greater than (&gt;), greater than or equal to (&gt;=), equal to (===),
    less than or equal to (&lt;=), or less than (&lt;).
  - This is NOT the value for the total parameter, only the base parameter.
  - The base parameter is calculated by the user's class parameter value and
    any bonuses received through permanent stat increases.

  learned skill: x
  learned skill: name
  - This will make the piece of equipment require the actor to have learned
    skill 'x'.
  - If 'name' is used, priority will be given to the skill with the highest
    ID in the database.
  - The actor needs to have LEARNED the skill. This means that if you have
    added a skill to the actor's kit through a trait, it will not count.

  switch: x
  - This will require switch X to be on.
  - If it isn't, the piece of equipment cannot be worn.
  - Insert multiple of these to add more switches that are are required to
    be on.

  ***NOTE 1***
  There is no "class: x" for these equip requirements. Instead, use the
  &lt;Equip For Class Only: x&gt; notetags.

  ***NOTE 2***
  For those wondering where "unique only" is, that does not exist in this
  plugin. Instead, use the &lt;Equip Copy Limit: x&gt; notetag listed above.

  Example A:

    &lt;Equip Requirements&gt;
    level &gt;= 20
    &lt;/Equip Requirements&gt;

    - Requires the user to be at least level 20 in order to equip.

  Example B:

    &lt;Equip Requirements&gt;
    atk &gt;= 50
    def &lt;= 50
    &lt;/Equip Requirements&gt;
    - Requires the user have at least 50 base ATK to equip.
    - Requires the user to be under 50 base DEF to equip.

<pre>&lt;Added EType: x&gt;
&lt;Added ETypes: x, x, x&gt;

- Used for: Armor Notetags
- This is for armors only and does NOT work with weapons!
- Allows a piece of armor to belong to multiple ETypes. This means a glove
  can be equipped as "Armgear" or as an "Accessory" if you so choose.
- Replace 'x' with a number representing the ID of the EType you wish to add
  to the list of ETypes.
  - Insert multiple 'x' entries to add more than one EType ID.

<pre>&lt;Cursed&gt;

- Used for: Weapon, Armor Notetags
- If this weapon or armor is equipped, it cannot manually be removed by the
  player until it is purified.
- To remove it, it must be done by event commands, script calls, or through
  the Purify-related Plugin Commands provided by this plugin.
- Once purified, the weapon or armor will become unequipped unless it has a
  purify transformation.
  - If the newly transformed weapon/armor is equippable, it will remain in
    the actor's equipment slots.
- If you are using VisuMZ_2_WeaponSwapSystem, weapons cannot become cursed
  in order to allow free weapon swapping. Weaponry will not be cursed
  if VisuMZ_2_WeaponSwapSystem is installed.

<pre>&lt;JS Parameters&gt;
 MaxHP = code;
 MaxMP = code;
 ATK = code;
 DEF = code;
 MAT = code;
 MDF = code;
 AGI = code;
 LUK = code;
&lt;/JS Parameters&gt;

- Used for: Weapon, Armor Notetags
- Uses JavaScript to determine the values for the basic parameters based on
  the code used to calculate its value.
- The variables 'MaxHP', 'MaxMP', 'ATK', 'DEF', 'MAT', 'MDF', 'AGI', and
  'LUK' are used to determine the finalized value of the parameter. This
  variable is case sensitive.
- If a parameter is not present, its value will be treated as +0.

'''WARNING!''' If you are trying to calculate a value based off a full
parameter value, such as "ATK = user.atk * 0.10", it's going to break and
will cause an infinite loop. Use base parameter values instead.

  to refer to. If you are using a name version, replace name with the full
  name of the item (it is case sensitive). The first item on the list before
  the&#160;: is the pair item for item concoctions. The second item on the list
  after the&#160;: is the item effect that will occur when the base and pair
  items are combined. The effects of the first and second items are
  unrelated to the combined item effect.

Example:

&lt;Concoctions&gt;

&lt;Footprint d Pattern p Offset: +x, -x&gt;
&lt;Footprint d Pattern p Offset: -x, +x&gt;

- Used for: Actor Notetags, Event Notetags, or Event Page Comment Tags
- For non-image generated footprints, these notetags let you set the offsets
  X and Y of the footprint for 'd' direction and 'p' pattern.
- Replace 'd' with text representing the direction the setting is for. Use
  any of the directions below:
  - down, left, right, up
  - lower left, lower right, upper left, upper right
- Replace 'p' with a number representing the pattern index. Patterns are
  the individual frames used in the sprite when walking.
  - By default, RPG Maker MZ sprites have the following patterns:
  - Left frame is pattern 0.
  - Center frame is pattern 1.
  - Right frame is pattern 2.
- Replace 'x' and 'y' with numeric values the exact number of pixels to
  offset the footprint's x and y coordinates by.
- Examples:
  - &lt;Footprint Up Pattern 0 Width: +4, +2&gt;
  - &lt;Footprint Right Pattern 2 Height: -6, -4&gt;

  Smart Jump to interact with.
- Replace 'x' with a number (0 to 255) representing the region ID to use as
  a height marker.
  - Insert multiple numbers to mark more regions.
- Height-Based Region interactions work as follows:
  - Players can jump from a height-based region to another height-based
    region of the same or lower value as long as that region is listed, too.
    - Regions listed: 10, 13, 15.
    - ie. The player can jump from Region 15 to 15.
    - ie. The player can jump from Region 15 to 13.
    - ie. The player can jump from Region 15 to 10.
    - ie. The player CANNOT jump from Region 13 to 15.
    - ie. The player CANNOT jump from Region 10 to 13.
    - ie. The player CANNOT jump from Region 10 to 15.
  - The lowest value number in the list is considered a "ledge" and the
    lowest possible level.
  - Players can jump in and out of the lowest level regions into non-height
    marked regions.
  - If the player is jumping towards the up, left, right directions, they
    cannot jump directly into a "ledge" region unless they are adjacent to
    the marked tile. A distance greater than 1 tile apart cannot be and the
    jump will be cut short.
  - If the player is jumping upward towards a "ledge", the player will jump
    directly onto the next available tile.
  - If the player is jumping towards the left or right directions into a
    "ledge" region, the player will "fall" a tile distance equal to the
    difference from the region height they're jumping from.
    - Regions listed: 10, 13, 15.
    - If the player is on Region 15 and jumps into a ledge (10), the player
      will drop 5 tiles downward.
    - If the player is on Region 13 and jumps into a ledge (10), the player
      will drop 3 tiles downward.
  - If the player is jumping downward towards a "ledge", the player will
    jump the full distance.
  - Examples:
    - &lt;Smart Jump Height-Based Regions: 10, 13, 15&gt;
      - Region 10 will be considered the "ledge" region.

Keep in mind that despite the fact that there is Height-Based Region support
for Smart Jump, maps in RPG Maker MZ are still inherently 2D. Therefore, not
everything will look correct for every jump-related scenario involving
region heights. You may need to make adjustments to maps that work best for
the limited 2D nature of mapping in order to adhere to what Height-Based
Region support can handle.

  than the reset amount or reset it if the current turn count is lower.
- 'Add' will add the state's turn count to the applied amount.
- If this notetag isn't used, it will use the rules set in the States &gt;
  Plugin Parameters.

<pre>&lt;Positive State&gt;
&lt;Negative State&gt;

- Used for: State Notetags
- Marks the state as a positive state or negative state, also altering the
  state's turn count color to match the Plugin Parameter settings.

- Used for: State Notetags
- Code used to determine how much slip damage is dealt to the affected unit
  during each regeneration phase.
- Replace 'type' with 'HP', 'MP', or 'TP'.

- The 'user' variable refers to the origin of the state.
- The 'target' variable refers to the affected unit receiving the damage.
- The 'state' variable refers to the current state being affected.
- The 'damage' variable is the finalized slip damage to be dealt.
- When these states are applied via action effects, the slip calculations
  are one time calculations made upon applying and the damage is cached to
  be used for future on regeneration calculations.
- For that reason, do not include game mechanics here such as adding states,
  buffs, debuffs, etc. as this notetag is meant for calculations only. Use
  the VisuStella Battle Core's &lt;JS Pre-Regenerate&gt; and &lt;JS Post-Regenerate&gt;

</p><p>Passive States are states that are always applied to actors and enemies
provided that their conditions have been met. These can be granted through
database objects or through the Passive States Plugin Parameters.
</p><p><br />
---
</p><p>For those using the code "a.isStateAffected(10)" to check if a target is
affected by a state or not, this does NOT check passive states. This only
checks for states that were directly applied to the target.
</p><p>This is NOT a bug.
</p><p>Instead, use "a.states().includes($dataStates[10])" to check for them. This
code will search for both directly applied states and passive states alike.
</p><p>---
</p><p>As passive states are NOT considered directly applied to, they do NOT match
a Conditional Branch's state check as well. The Conditional Branch effect
checks for an affected state.
</p><p>---
</p><p>Because passive states are NOT directly applied to a battler, the functions
of "addNewState", "addState", "eraseState", "removeState" do NOT apply to
passive states either. This means that any of the related JS notetags tied
to those functions will not occur either.
</p><p>---
</p><p>Why are passive states not considered affected by? Let's look at it
differently. There are two ways to grant skills to actors. They can acquire
skills by levels/items/events or they can equip gear that temporarily grants
the skill in question.
</p><p>Learning the skill is direct. Temporarily granting the skill is indirect.
These two factors have mechanical importance and require differentiation.
</p><p>Regular states and passive states are the same way. Regular states are
directly applied, therefore, need to be distinguished in order for things
like state turns and steps, removal conditionals, and similar to matter at
all. Passive states are indirect and are therefore, unaffected by state
turns, steps, and removal conditions. These mechanical differences are
important for how RPG Maker works.
</p><p>---
</p><p>Once again, it is NOT a bug that when using "a.isStateAffected(10)" to
check if a target has a passive state will return false.
</p><p>---
</p>
<pre>&lt;Passive State: x&gt;
&lt;Passive States: x,x,x&gt;

&lt;Passive State: name&gt;
&lt;Passive States: name, name, name&gt;

- Used for: Actor, Class, Skill, Item, Weapon, Armor, Enemy Notetags
- Adds passive state(s) x to trait object, applying it to affected actor or
  enemy unit(s).
- Replace 'x' with a number to determine which state to add as a passive.
- If using 'name' notetag variant, replace 'name' with the name of the
  state(s) to add as a passive.
- Note: If you plan on applying a passive state through a skill, it must be
  through a skill that has been learned by the target and not a skill that
  is given through a trait.
</pre>
<p>---
</p>
<pre>&lt;Passive Stackable&gt;

- Used for: State Notetags

- Used for: State Notetags
- Determines the passive condition of the passive state based on the actor's
  current class. As long as the actor's current class matches one of the
  data entries, the passive condition is considered passed.
- For 'id' variant, replace 'id' with a number representing class's ID.
- For 'name' variant, replace 'name' with the class's name.
- This does not affect enemies.

- Used for: State Notetags
- Requires VisuMZ_2_ClassChangeSystem!
- Determines the passive condition of the passive state based on the actor's
  multiclasses. As long as the actor has any of the matching classes
  assigned as a multiclass, the passive condition is considered passed.
- For 'id' variant, replace 'id' with a number representing class's ID.
- For 'name' variant, replace 'name' with the class's name.
- This does not affect enemies.

<pre>&lt;Passive Condition Switch ON: x&gt;

&lt;Passive Condition All Switches ON: x,x,x&gt;
&lt;Passive Condition Any Switch ON: x,x,x&gt;

- Used for: State Notetags
- Determines the passive condition of the passive state based on switches.
- Replace 'x' with the switch ID to determine the state's passive condition.
- If 'All' notetag variant is used, conditions will not be met until all
  switches are ON. Then, it would be met.
- If 'Any' notetag variant is used, conditions will be met if any of the
  switches are ON. Otherwise, it would not be met.

- Determines the passive condition of the passive state based on switches.
- Replace 'x' with the switch ID to determine the state's passive condition.
- If 'All' notetag variant is used, conditions will not be met until all
  switches are OFF. Then, it would be met.
- If 'Any' notetag variant is used, conditions will be met if any of the

</p>
<pre>&lt;JS Passive Condition&gt;
 code
 code
 condition = code;
&lt;/JS Passive Condition&gt;

- Used for: State Notetags
- Determines the passive condition of the state based on JavaScript code.
- Replace 'code' to determine if a passive state's condition has been met.
- The 'condition' variable returns a boolean (true/false) to determine if
  the passive state's condition is met or not.
- The 'user' variable refers to the user affected by the passive state.
- The 'state' variable refers to the passive state being checked.
- All other passive conditions must be met for this code to count.

**NOTE** Not everything can be used as a custom JS Passive Condition due to
limitations of the code. There are failsafe checks to prevent infinite loops
and some passive conditions will not register for this reason and the
conditional checks will behave as if the passive states have NOT been
applied for this reason. Such examples include the following:

- A passive state that requires another passive state
- A passive state that requires a trait effect from another state
- A passive state that requires a parameter value altered by another state
- A passive state that requires equipment to be worn but its equipment type
  access is provided by another state.
- Anything else that is similar in style.

<pre>&lt;JS Steal Rate&gt;
 code
 code
 rate = code;
&lt;/JS Steal Rate&gt;

- Used for: Skill, Item Notetags
- Uses JavaScript code to determine the success rate of the steal action.
  - The 'rate' value is multiplied against the success rate of the target
    item being stolen. This is a multiplicative stack.
  - This means an item's default steal rate of 5% and a 200% steal rate on
    this notetag's 'rate' variable will yield 10%. Alternatively, if the
    default steal rate is 0%, it will yield 0% regardless of this notetag's
    'rate' variable value.
- This applies to all steal target types.
- The 'rate' variable starts at a value equal to the current success rate.
- The 'rate' variable will be returned as the declared success rate.
- The 'user' variable represents the user who will perform the skill/item.
- The 'target' variable represents the target who was stolen from.

</p><p>Bounce tiles will cause affected characters that step over them to jump
forward a specified amount of spaces based on their regions/terrain tags.
This allows characters to scale past obstacles and/or other events!
</p><p>This jump effect has no rules other than it jumps forward that many spaces.
The no rules bit means the jump tile is capable of launching characters into
walls and/or on top of other events, so place your bounce tiles carefully!
We are not responsible for any weird landing locations!
</p><p>If you are making maps where events can launch themselves with the aid of
bounce tiles, we recommend putting either slippery tiles or force move tiles
to move those events out of the way in the scenario where the player is
following behind. This is to prevent the player from landing on top of the
event.

  battler sprite to 'x' or 'x%'.
- Replace 'x' with a number from 0 to 255 representing the opacity level.
- Replace 'x%' with a percentage from 0% to 100% representing the opacity.
- This does NOT affect UI elements like the HP Gauges, State Icons, or their
  positioning markers such as the battler's shadow as this is only to used
  to represent a change in their opacity through a state.
- To change the whole battler's opacity including everything from the UI
  elements, State Icons, etc., use the Action Sequence Plugin Command to
  visually alter the whole opacity level instead.

  battler. Higher numbers are faster. Lower numbers are slower.
- This does NOT affect UI elements like the HP Gauges, State Icons, or their
  positioning markers such as the battler's shadow as this is only to used
  to represent a change in their opacity through a state.
- The Visual Rainbow shift will be stacked on top of any battlers/enemies
  that already have a hue change.

- If this is placed in a notetag, the effect will be present across
  all event pages used.
- If this is placed inside a page's comment, the effect will only occur
  if that event page is currently active.

</p><p>In order to use reflections, you need to use tiles that are semi-transparent
or fully transparent. For example, water reflections need to come from tiles
that have been modified to be semi-transparent or fully transparent. If the
tile is completely opaque, the reflection will not show through. This rule
also applies to ground surfaces.

<pre>&lt;Water Reflection Region: id&gt;
&lt;Water Reflection Regions: id, id, id&gt;

&lt;Solid Reflection Region: id&gt;
&lt;Solid Reflection Regions: id, id, id&gt;

- Used for: Map Notetags
- Sets the tiles marked by the region ID's to become reflective.
- This will override the Plugin Parameter settings for this map.
  - This does not add upon them.
- Replace 'id' with a region ID between 1 and 255.
  - Region 0 is ignored and will not work.
- Insert multiple ID's to mark more tiles the parallax can appear on.
- If these tags aren't used, refer to the settings found in the Plugin
  Parameter defaults.
- WARNING: This WILL cause longer load times on larger maps.

<pre>&lt;Water Reflection Top&gt;
&lt;Water Reflection Bottom&gt;

&lt;Solid Reflection Top&gt;
&lt;Solid Reflection Bottom&gt;

- Used for: Map Notetags
- This will put the reflection layer either above all of the newly added
  parallaxes or below them.
  - If placed below, the reflection layer will not appear below the map
    editor's parallax layer.
  - If you change them to appear below the parallaxes, then pay attention to
    the opacity level of the parallaxes. If the parallaxes are too opaque,
    you will barely see the reflection.
- If these tags aren't used, refer to the settings found in the Plugin
  Parameter defaults.

<pre>&lt;Water Reflection Boundary: x&gt;

&lt;Water Reflection Amplitude: start, end&gt;

&lt;Water Reflection Wavelength: start, end&gt;

- Used for: Map Notetags
- Requires Pixi JS Filters installed for the game project.
- These settings adjust the water reflection's ripple intensity.
- Replace Boundary's 'x' with a number value between 0 and 1.
  - Vertical position of the reflection point, default is 50% (middle)
    smaller numbers produce a larger reflection, larger numbers produce a
    smaller reflection. This also means that reflections closer to the edges
    will also have a different visual ripple effect than those towards the
    middle of the reflection.
- Replace Amplitude's 'start' and 'end' with number values representing how
  much to alter the intensity by.
  - Starting and ending amplitude of waves allows you to control the
    intensity of the reflection ripples.
  - Use larger numbers for more intensity.
- Replace Wavelength's 'start' and 'end' with number values representing the
  wave size.
  - Starting and ending wavelength values determine the size of the ripples
    for the reflection filter.
  - Use larger numbers for larger wave sizes.

<pre>&lt;Weapon Image: x&gt;

- Used for: Actor, Class, Weapon, Armor, Enemy, State Notetags
- Changes the weapon image used for the affected battler to a numeric type.
- Replace 'x' with a number representing the weapon image's ID.
- You'll get an image from "img/system/" folder's weapon sheets.
- Each sheet contains 12 weapon images. If you wish to load a weapon from
  the first sheet, it'll be within 1-12.
- If you wish to load a weapon from the second sheet, it'll be within 13-24,
  and so on.

<pre>&lt;Attack Animation: x&gt;
&lt;Weapon Animation: x&gt;

- Used for: State Notetags
- When the battler attacks while having a state with this notetag, the
  battler's attack animation will be changed to 'x'.
- This can be used for things like a "Burning Weapon" state that turns the
  attack animation into a flame attack instead of the normal attack.
- This only applies when a skill/item's animation is set to "Normal Attack".
- Replace 'x' with a number representing the animation's ID.
- If a battler is affected by multiple states with these notetags, then the
  state with the highest priority number will have its effect take place.
- There are no differences between the notetags. They both achieve the same
  functionality. &lt;Weapon Animation: x&gt; happens to be a legacy notetag
  carried from YEP's library.
