 * Introduction
 * ============================================================================
 * 
 * Games that use random elements in their game can benefit by using visualized
 * Dice Rolls in order to give players an understanding of what kind of logic
 * is happening behind the randomization. Various things like switches, items,
 * and skills can also affect the roll values to give the player more control
 * over the nature of RNG. However, to give the game developer more control,
 * Random Number Seeds are also provided through this plugin. These seeds allow
 * for games to function in a more controlled pattern and prevent things like
 * save scumming for better results. Though the numbers themselves are still
 * random, they will exhibit predetermined and predictable outcomes through the
 * usage of Plugin Commands.
 *
 * Features include all (but not limited to) the following:
 * 
 * * Visualized Dice Rolls can be called through Plugin Commands, using 4-sided
 *   dice, 6-sided dice, 8-sided, 10-sided, 12-sided, and 20-sided dice.
 * * Dice Rolls can be modified through dice effects, either automatic or bonus
 *   effets using player input.
 * * Dice effects include changing the number of Dice Rolled, the sides each
 *   dice has, and/or modifiers that affect the final roll.
 * * Random Number Seeds allow for predetermined randomized outcomes when
 *   rolling for random numbers.
 * * Custom Random Number Seeds can be numbers or text, allowing you to make
 *   truly unique cases for various random number batches.
 * * Dice Rolls can also be controlled through Random Number Seeds.
 * * Reset the custom seed state and begin the seed anew.
 * * Notetags can allow skills and items to also utilize Random Number Seeds to
 *   give RNG-generated results.
 * * "Daily" effect can affect and provide specialized Random Number Seeds for
 *   just that day.
 * * "Unique" effect will affect and provide specialized Random Number Seed for
 *   that save game and any other branching saves made after.
 * * Control these seeded random numbers through Plugin Commands or JavaScript
 *   script calls.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Requirements
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This plugin is made for RPG Maker MZ. This will not work in other iterations
 * of RPG Maker.
 *
 * ------ Tier 4 ------
 *
 * This plugin is a Tier 4 plugin. Place it under other plugins of lower tier
 * value on your Plugin Manager list (ie: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). This is to ensure
 * that your plugins will have the best compatibility with the rest of the
 * VisuStella MZ library.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Dice Rolls Visualized
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This section explains how visualized Dice Rolls work. These visualized Dice
 * Rolls give a player a visual understanding of how the randomized numbers
 * play out before them.
 *
 * ---
 * 
 * === Dice Count, Advantage, Disadvantage ===
 * 
 * Depending on the type of Dice Roll you're making, dice count can mean
 * different things. For the Plugin Command "Dice: Roll Value", the dice count
 * refers to just the total number of Dice Rolled, and from there, the highest,
 * lowest, average, or total amount calculated from the dice will be recorded.
 * 
 * However, when using the Plugin Command "Dice: Target Value", the mechanics
 * known as "Advantage" and "Disadvantage" are used.
 * 
 * When in an "Advantage" state, the player throws multiple dice (anything
 * above 1 dice). From there, the highest value is selected if going for
 * "above/equal" target value. The lowest value is selected if the Plugin
 * Command has the player aiming for below/equal target value.
 * 
 * In a "Disadvantage" state, just like with the "Advantage" state, the player
 * throws multiple dice. However, the opposite happens. When going for
 * above/equal target value, instead of selecting the highest value, the lowest
 * dice value is selected instead. When going for "below/equal" target value,
 * the highest value is selected rather than the lowest.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * === Dice Sides ===
 * 
 * The number of sides a dice has will be either 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 20 for the
 * purpose of this plugin. While we can create more options, these are the most
 * popular polyhedral dice that you will see, stemming from a variety of board
 * games and tabletop RPG's. These dice will also be known as D4, D6, D8, D10,
 * D12, and D20 each referring to the number of sides they have.
 * 
 * The number of sides a dice has will determine its rank also. For the purpose
 * of this plugin, there are six ranks to match the six types of dice we have
 * available.
 * 
 *   Rank 1 - D4
 *   Rank 2 - D6
 *   Rank 3 - D8
 *   Rank 4 - D10
 *   Rank 5 - D12
 *   Rank 6 - D20
 * 
 * Ranks are used in Dice Roll automatic effects and bonus effects. By raising
 * a dice's rank, a D6 can transform into a D8 for example. Lowering a dice's
 * rank can transform said D6 into a D4. For this plugin, ranks cannot go below
 * Rank 1 (D4) and cannot go above Rank 6 (D20).
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * === Dice Modifiers ===
 * 
 * When rolls are decided, modifiers are then applied to the Dice Roll number.
 * For example, if a player has "Modifier +3" and rolls a 10, the number adds
 * the +3 modifier and becomes a 13. The 13 is then used to record the numeric
 * value of the roll and/or determine if the roll is successful or not. The
 * modified roll number can also exceed the number of sides on the dice.
 * 
 * Negative modifiers can also exist and send the roll value going the other
 * way. For example, if a player has "Modifier -2" and rolls a 10, the number
 * applies the -2 modifier and becomes 8 instead. The 8 is then used to record
 * the numeric value of the roll and/or determine if the roll is successful or
 * not. The modified roll number can also go below 1 and reach 0 or negative
 * numbers, too.
 * 
 * Modifiers can also have a random element. This random element is calculated
 * when the modifier is being applied and will utilize the Dice Roll's Random
 * Number Seed if specified. As such, the display range for the modifier will
 * show the modifier minimum with the potential maximum modifier.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * === Natural Rolls ===
 * 
 * Regarding dice modifiers, there is a slight rule tweak if you are using the
 * Plugin Command "Dice: Target Value" to roll dice. If the command option of
 * "Allow Natural Rolls?" parameter is enabled and set to "true", then there
 * are two special numbers that, when rolled, will ignore modifiers and will
 * count as either an automatic success or an automatic failure. These numbers
 * are 1 and whatever number is the maximum number of sides on the dice.
 * 
 * For example, on a D20, a Natural 1 will result in instant failure while a
 * Natural 20 will result in instant success regardless of the modifiers or
 * whatever target value needs to be reached. If a target value needed to be
 * reached happens to be 25, and the player rolls a Natural 20, it will still
 * count as a success provided that the player is going for an "above/equal"
 * target value.
 * 
 * The opposite is true when going for a "below/equal" target value. Rolling a
 * Natural 1 will count as an automatic success while rolling the max value of
 * the dice will count as an automatic failure regardless of the target value.
 * 
 * Natural rolls will still be recorded normally to variables and switches.
 * There's no indicators suggesting that they are "critical successes" or
 * "critical failures". Instead, just as "success" and "failure". If you wish
 * to portray the "critical" nature of the roll, best use the variable to
 * determine if anything 1 and below, or anything equal or higher than max to
 * be considered "criticals" of either extreme.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * === Automatic Effects ===
 * 
 * Automatic Effects are dice effects that are automatically applied at the
 * start of a Dice Roll, from before the Dice Roll appears on screen. These
 * effects can modify dice counts, alter advantage and disadvantage, raise or
 * lower dice ranks, and adjust Dice Roll modifiers. The effects range from
 * general effects that always occur or based off certain JavaScript conditions
 * to other effects like if a certain actor has a skill available to use.
 * 
 * If, for whatever reason, an Automatic Effect's conditions were to suddenly
 * be enabled during the middle of the Dice Roll, it would not suddenly become
 * active and grant the dice effects to the roll. Likewise, if an Automatic
 * Effect's conditions were to suddenly be unmet during the middle of a Dice
 * Roll, the dice effects would not be revoked either. The Automatic Effects to
 * be used will always be determined at the start, before the Dice Roll even
 * appears on screen.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * === Bonus Effects ===
 * 
 * Unlike Automatic Effects, Bonus Effects are applied by the player manually.
 * They can alter dice counts, advantage, disadvantage, ranks, and modifiers
 * just like Automatic Effects can, but the player has the option of doing so.
 * Some effects have a limited number of times they can be used while others.
 * Other effects will not only require an actor to know a specific skill, but
 * also to be able to pay for them.
 * 
 * These Bonus Effects, once selected and activated, will grant their dice
 * effects for the rest of the Dice Roll. Even if the conditions would be unmet
 * later, the dice effects will remain until the Dice Roll finishes. However,
 * the Bonus Effects that are available to be selected from the start will be
 * the only ones available for selection at all during the Dice Roll. This
 * means that even if a show condition (like switches or JS: Show) is met
 * halfway through, it will not appear in the list unless it was there from the
 * start. The same goes for variable, item, and skill conditions. This is to
 * match the same enabling/visibility settings that Automatic Effects have.
 *

 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Random Number Seeds
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This section explains how Random Number Seeds work.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * === Random Number Seeds ===
 * 
 * Seeds will initialize a random number generator. Retrieving random numbers
 * from this same seed will give the same sequence of random numbers when
 * restarted or continued. If a different seed is used, then different number
 * sequences will occur. It's useful for replication experiments or simulations
 * while preventing things like save scumming for different randomized results.
 * 
 * Let's take a look at how this works. If we use the Plugin Command to
 * generate a random number between 0 and 100 using the seed "RpgTsukuru", then
 * the numbers will appear in this order:
 * 
 *   11   82   25   2   16   44   69   41   87   97   43   99   2   21   15
 * 
 * And so on. This will occur whenever you start a new game or reset the 
 * "RpgTsukuru" seed in that exact order when looking for numbers between 0 and
 * 100. This is because the algorithm used to solve for the Random Number Seed
 * will always yield those results adding a level of predictability.
 * 
 * *NOTE* Keep in mind that when you are using the script call, the value you
 * will get will be a float (a decimal number between 0 and 1 like 0.123456789)
 * and not a clean and clear integar like with the Plugin Commands. This is to
 * replicate the "Math.random()" JavaScript function so all you have to do is
 * simply replace "Math.random()" with "$rngSeed('RpgTsukuru')" to get the kind
 * of randomized results you would with Math.random() except through a seed.
 * 
 * Now, the reason why we would have multiple seed keys is so that you can have
 * repeatable results for things that are totally different from one another.
 * For instance, "SafeCombination" will have a different door locked than
 * "HideAndSeek" for different simulations. This allows you to do them in any
 * order and have the safe combinations and hide and seek locations be the same
 * per the simulation you are doing things in.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * === Daily Marker ===
 * 
 * For those who want certain puzzles to vary from day to day, but will always
 * have the same starting pattern upon a reset, then apply the Daily Marker to
 * the Random Number Seed either in the Plugin Command or script call. This
 * will make it yield different results than from the non-version, so do NOT
 * expect it to give the same number results.
 * 
 * The daily marker will change at 12:00am on the dot based on the player's
 * PC's current time zone and time/date settings.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * === Save-Unique Marker ===
 * 
 * This plugin will drop a unique marker for each playthrough and that marker
 * is the "Save-Unique" marker. It can be applied to a Random Number Seed to
 * make it different from the pure seed and/or daily marker-applied seed. This
 * way, the "RpgTsukuru" seed won't yield the same numbers as it did for a past
 * playthrough.
 * 
 * Keep in mind that since this is per save/playthrough, that means any
 * branching saves will retain the same marker and provide the same results
 * through seeded random numbers.
 * 
 * *NOTE* If this plugin is installed after multiple saves have been made, then
 * each of those saves will have their own "Save-Unique" marker regardless of
 * their origins, shared or not. This is NOT a bug and it cannot be changed.
 *
 * ---
 * 
 * === Potential Uses for Random Number Seeds ===
 * 
 * Here are some potential uses for Random Number Seeds:
 * 
 * * Randomized puzzles: Puzzles can have different randomized starting points,
 * and by seeding them, it prevents the player from abusing the reset
 * function to get a favorable starting point.
 * 
 * * Randomized cutscenes: Sometimes, you want certain event cutscenes to
 * trigger randomly. This allows for that to happen without the player save
 * scumming to get the desired cutscene. Instead, the player will have to
 * make do with whatever cutscene they found.
 * 
 * * Randomized gambling: Does your game have a casino? Do you want to make
 * sure your player has to live with the conequences of the risks taken? By
 * using a Random Number Seed, reloading a save is no longer possible to let
 * them escape their fate from chance.
 * 
 * * Randomized choices: If you're using the VisuStella MZ Message Core and
 * using the <Shuffle> text code for choices, you can use this plugin's text
 * codes to add in Random Number Seeds to allow for randomized choices, too.
 * By using the Random Number Seed, reloading a save won't let the player get
 * new choices with the shuffled choices.

 * ============================================================================
 * Extra Features
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * There are some extra features found if other VisuStella MZ plugins are found
 * present in the Plugin Manager list.
 *
 * ---
 * 
 * VisuMZ_1_BattleCore
 * 
 * Those using VisuStella MZ's Battle Core can launch visualized Dice Roll
 * Plugin Commands from this plugin during the middle of Action Sequences as
 * long as there is not a conflicting effect during it.
 * 
 * Conflict effects include Active Chain Skills, Input Combo Skills, or 
 * Evolution Matrix Skills. Dice-related Plugin Commands will not run at all
 * while these skill mechanics are active.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * VisuMZ_1_ItemsEquipsCore
 * 
 * During Dice Rolls, you can have certain Automatic Effects or Bonus Effects
 * require the presence or usage of items, weapons, and/or armors. If those
 * items have a <Color: x> notetag inside them, the VisuStella MZ Items &
 * Equips Core will allow the color effect to go through. However, if the color
 * notetag is <Color: #rrggbb>, extra help will be required from the VisuStella
 * MZ Message Core for it to work.
 * 
 * ---
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Notetags
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The following are notetags that have been added through this plugin. These
 * notetags will not work with your game if this plugin is OFF or not present.
 *
 * ---
 * 
 * === Action-Related Notetags ===
 * 
 * ---
 *
 * <RNG Seed: x>
 * <Daily Seed: x>
 * <Unique Seed: x>
 * <Daily Unique Seed: x>
 *
 * - Used for: Skill, Item Notetags
 * - Causes the skill or item to utilize Random Number Seeds to yield
 *   predictable outcomes for damage, hit rate, critical rate, etc.
 * - Replace 'x' with the "seed" you would like to use.
 *   - Replace 'x' with "auto" to automatically name the seed based on the
 *     skill/item's name.
 *   - Seed will be furthered modified by the plugin based on the user, the
 *     target, and the action used as to prevent RNG manipulation.
 * - "RNG Seed" variant is a generalized seed.
 * - "Daily Seed" variant will have results vary based on the day.
 * - "Unique Seed" variant will have results vary based on save marker.
 * - "Daily Unique Seed" variant will have results vary based on the day and
 *     and save marker.
 * - Only applies to the happenings of inside Game_Action.prototype.apply and
 *   Action Sequence - MECH: Action Effect.
 *   - For all other things, utilize the Plugin Commands for this plugin to
 *     grab RNG-generated values within variables and use that or use the
 *     script calls to access RNG-generated results.
 * - If this notetag is not used, default to the settings found in the Plugin
 *   Parameters for the default action Random Number Generator seed.
 * 
 *   Example:
 * 
 *     <Unique Seed: RpgTsukuru>
 *
 * ---
 * 
 * <No RNG Seed>
 * 
 * - Used for: Skill, Item Notetags
 * - Used to suppress the Plugin Parameter's default action Random Number
 *   Generator seed and to prevent this skill/item from using RNG seeds.
